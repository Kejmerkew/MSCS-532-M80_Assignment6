# ⚙️ Part 1: Implementation and Analysis of Selection Algorithms

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and performance analysis of algorithms for finding the **k-th smallest element** in an array — also known as **order statistics**. It includes both the **deterministic Median of Medians algorithm** (guaranteed worst-case linear time) and the **randomized Quickselect algorithm** (expected linear time).  

The study compares their theoretical complexities and empirical performance across different input distributions.

## 🧮 Implemented Algorithms

### 1. **Deterministic Selection (Median of Medians)**
- Guarantees **O(n)** time complexity in the **worst case**.  
- Works by dividing the array into groups of five, finding medians recursively, and using the median of these medians as a pivot.  
- Provides stability and predictable performance even on adversarial inputs.

### 2. **Randomized Selection (Quickselect)**
- Achieves **O(n)** time on **average** but may degrade to **O(n²)** in the worst case.  
- Randomly chooses a pivot for partitioning, which works efficiently for most real-world datasets.
